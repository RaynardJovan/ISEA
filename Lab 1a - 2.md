Public vs Private IP Reflection 

<img width="1282" height="799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9682ce19-031f-4c24-9841-0c7b1e99a67d" />

The differance of public and privet IP is a public IP address is unique and visible to everyone and It ensures that we can be clearly identified on the internet, on the other hand a private IP address is only used within a private network

A short reflection (100–200 words) covering: 
• GUI vs CLI experience 

  GUIs offer intuitive and visual interaction its perfect for general task, whereas CLIs provide precision, scriptability, and efficiency if you know the commands. I appreciate both: GUIs for exploring new tools, CLIs for automation and power-user workflows.

• Software installation methods pros/cons (SaaS, repo, manual, source) 

  - SaaA (Software as a service): offers zero installation, always updated, but requires internet and less control
  - Repo: Streamlined updates and dependency handling, but limited to repository offerings
  - Manual: Offers simplicity and reliablity, though updates become your responsibility
  - Source: provides total control, maximum customization and learning opportunity at the cost of complexity and time.
    
• Your preference as a user and as a future software developer 
  As a user, I prioritize the seamless, polished experience of a GUI and the "set it and forget it" nature of SaaS for daily productivity. However, as a future software developer, I prefer leans toward the CLI and repository-based installations. In a development context, the ability to script environment setups and ensure reproducible builds is essential.
